Subject: [nuke-ms-users] First snapshot of nuke-ms released

Hello to all readers of this message!

I am pleased to present you the first snapshot of my Project, the Nuclear
Messaging System.
This snapshot with the version number 0.1 is the first version of the Project of
which I am not ashamed of to show around.


What nuke-ms is:

Right now it is just a rudimentary program which can transmit text messages over
the network. It's not a lot of code, it is not convenient and I won't even start
about security. However, it is *my* project which hopefully will grow.


What nuke-ms is supposed to become:

A distributed, secure and stable instant messaging system.
Distributed means that instead of trusting on one server, one owner or one
hoster with your messages, with nuke-ms you will be able to connect to a whole
network of wervers and messages will be passed to any user connected to the
network via as many nodes as necessary.
Secure means: communication is going to be encrypted and authenticated
end-to-end and it is going to happen with client-client, server-server and
between client-server connections.
Stable means: should one or several nodes in the network fail, transmit messages
unreliably or behave malicously different routes to the destination will be chosen.


Where you can get nuke-ms:

nuke-ms is free software, it is released under the GNU General Public License
Version 3 (GPLv3). Use, alteration and distribution are not only allowed but
appreciated.
The project is hosted on BerliOS Developer, a German organisation supporting the
development of Open Source projects.
Various services such as a Git repository, a bugtracker or a wiki are provided.
You can browse the nuke-ms Project page here:

How you can compile nuke-ms:

Note that detailed instructions can be found in the file INSTALL.de.txt (German)
or INSTALL.en.txt (English) in the doc directory. The short instructions are:

Under Linux:
Install CMake >= 2.6, wxWidgets >= 2.8 und Boost >= 1.35 (the exact names for
some distributions can be found in the file doc/INSTALL.*.txt), then execute the
following lines from the project directory:

	cd build
	cmake ../src
	make
Now you should find the executables in the bin/ subdirectory.


Under Windows:
Please don't do that to yourself. I allready made that sacrifice, you can
download the result from the link above.


How to use nuke-ms:

For details, refer to the file README.de.txt (German) or README.en.txt
(English). The short instructions are:
 - Start the server (nuke-ms-serv)
 - Start the client (nuke-ms-client)
 - type "/connect <host>:34443" in the lower text field of the client (replace
<host> by the IP or hostname of the Host the server runs on)
 - Type your messages, send them away by hitting the enter key
 - Disconnecting with "/disconnect"
 - Closing of the client with "/exit", with File->Quit from the menu or by just
clicking the X in the upper right corner.
 - Closing of the servers by "kilall nuke-ms-serv", or hitting CTRL-C
